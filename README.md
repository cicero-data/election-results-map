# Election Results Map 2019

## About
This project used data from the Cicero Database to map every state legislator in the U.S. as of February 2019. The map uses a vector tileset of state legislative district and elected official data that must be placed in the `data` folder.

The public version of the map is available to view at https://azavea.github.io/election-results-map/.
